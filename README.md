A Linux utility that bridges USB keyboard input to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

## Features

- **Real-time Keyboard Input Forwarding**: Captures keystrokes from USB keyboards
  and forwards them as HID reports over BLE
- **Exclusive Input Capture**: Grabbed keyboards are "frozen" - keystrokes don't
  reach the host system, preventing interference with local applications
- **Hot-plug Support**: Automatically detects when keyboards are connected or
  disconnected
- **Multi-keyboard Support**: Can monitor multiple USB keyboards simultaneously
- **BLE Device Discovery**: Scans for and connects to BLE devices
- **HID Compliance**: Sends standard 8-byte HID keyboard reports compatible with
  most BLE devices
- **Safe Exit Hotkey**: Use Alt+Ctrl+H to safely exit the program while capturing
  keystrokes (Ctrl+C is disabled to prevent accidental termination)
- **Modern Command-Line Interface**: Comprehensive argument parsing with help,
  version, and configuration options
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed logging with configurable levels for debugging and
  monitoring
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit test suite covering all core functionality
  with 100% test pass rate and excellent code coverage
- **Automatic Versioning**: Centralized version management with build information

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install cmake qt6-base-dev qt6-connectivity-dev libudev-dev libevdev-dev

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Optionally run tests
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON && make && ctest

# Run (requires sudo for keyboard access)
sudo ./ninja_util
```

## Usage

```bash
./ninja_util --help                # Show all options
./ninja_util --version             # Show version info
./ninja_util -V                    # Run with verbose logging
./ninja_util --list-devices        # List BLE devices
./ninja_util --disable-auto-connect # Disable auto-connect to single NinjaUSB device
```

### Auto-Connect Feature

By default, if exactly one NinjaUSB device is found during scanning, the utility will automatically connect to it. This can be disabled with the `--disable-auto-connect` option if you prefer to manually select devices.

### Connection Handling

- **Connection Timeout**: Automatically exits if BLE connection fails within 30 seconds
- **Error Recovery**: Provides detailed error messages for different connection failure types
- **Graceful Exit**: Safely terminates the program if unable to establish BLE connection

## Related Projects

### ninjaUSB - BLE to USB HID Bridge Firmware

This utility complements the **ninjaUSB** project - a Zephyr-based firmware for the
nRF52840 dongle that creates a BLE to USB HID bridge.

- **Repository**: [ninjaUSB](https://github.com/mr-u0b0dy/ninjaUSB/tree/dev)
- **Purpose**: nRF52840-based firmware that receives keystrokes via BLE and outputs
  them through USB HID
- **Architecture**: Reverse bridge - while ninjaUSB-util sends USBâ†’BLE, ninjaUSB
  receives BLEâ†’USB
- **Hardware**: nRF52840 dongle running Zephyr RTOS
- **Use Case**: Together, these projects create a complete wireless keyboard bridge
  solution
